# Timeseries_forecasting


This project uses the Simple Exponential Smoothing method to forecast traffic volume. The code is written in Python and utilizes the pandas, numpy, statsmodels, matplotlib, math, and sklearn libraries.A SimpleExpSmoothing model is created with an alpha value of 0.3 and fitted to the historical data from each dataset. The model generates smoothed values for the historical data and forecasts the volume for the next 4 months.
